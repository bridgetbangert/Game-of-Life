# Game-of-Life

A java project I did in my Object Oriented Programming course. With any given input grid that is 20x20, this program will simulate Conway's Game of Life in the output.

## Input File
* The user may edit the file as they please, as long as it stays within the 20x20 size range.
* The "X"'s represent the alive cells, and the "."'s represent the dead cells.

## Main
* The user is able to adjust the game how they please, in the constructor the user may specify if they choose to use a different file in the parameters when creating a new game and how many generations they wish to see.
